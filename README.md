# Lung Simulator

A simplified representation of key ventilation- and lung-related parameters and their impact on ventilation metrics.

## What does the application do?
The application depicts a lung model, several modifiable physical parameters, and several scalar versus time waveforms that illustrate the impact of these parameters on key ventilation metrics.

## Who might use this application?
Learners of respiratory physiology.

## Why did I make this project?
I'm a respiratory therapist with a keen interest in respiratory physiology and mechanical ventilation.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create a lung profile using key parameters including: height, sex, tidal volume, respiratory rate, compliance, and resistance
- As a user, I want to know what the metrics for key ventilator scalars (e.g. volume versus time, flow versus time) are for a parameterized lung profile
- As a user, I want to be able to add the lung profiles I've created to a list
- As a user, I want to be able to view a lung profile from the list of profiles I've created
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a lung profile from the list of profiles I've created
- As a user, I want to be able to save the list of lung profiles I created to file and be reminded of such when I quit the application
- As a user, I want to be able to load lung profiles I've saved from file
- As a user, I want to have the option to continue where I left off when I quit the application
- As a user, I want to be able to select from a list of pre-defined, common pathologies of the lung
- As a user, I want to be able to observe both spontaneous and mechanical ventilation
- As a user, I want to be able to select from pre-defined modes of ventilation, adjust the settings of these modes, apply them to the respiratory system, and then observe the resulting metrics

# Lung Simulator

A simplified representation of key ventilation parameters and their impact on ventilation.

## What does the application do?
The application depicts a model of a respiratory system, several modifiable physical parameters, and several waveforms that illustrate the impact of these parameters on key ventilation metrics.

## Who might use this application?
Learners of respiratory physiology.

## Why did I make this project?
I'm a respiratory therapist with a keen interest in respiratory physiology and mechanical ventilation.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to adjust key parameters for a respiratory system including: compliance, resistance, height, and gender
- As a user, I want to be able observe how those parameters affect ventilation with key physical waveforms (e.g., pressure-time, volume-time, flow-time)
- As a user, I want to be able to select from a list of pre-defined, common pathologies of the lung
- As a user, I want to be able to add the respiratory system profiles I've created to a saved list
- As a user, I want to be able to view and load a profile from the list of profiles I've created
- As a user, I want to be able to observe both spontaneous and mechanical ventilation
- As a user, I want to be able to select from pre-defined modes of ventilation, adjust the settings of these modes, apply them to the respiratory system, and then observe the resulting metrics

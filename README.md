# Lung Simulator

A gross simplification of the impact of physical lung parameters on breathing.

## What does the application do?
The application depicts an oversimplified pair of lungs, several modifiable breathing-related parameters, and several waveforms that illustrate the impact of these parameters on key physical metrics of breathing.

## Who might use this application?
Learners of respiratory physiology.

## Why did I make this project?
I'm a respiratory therapist with a keen interest in respiratory physiology and mechanical ventilation.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add the lung profiles I've created to a saved list
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of lung profiles I've created
- As a user, I want to be able to adjust different lung-related parameters
- As a user, I want to be able to observe the key physical waveforms during the sponatenous breathing of parameterized lungs
